## **Organisation**

1st semester - 5 ECTS - 40 hours in the class.

Pedagogical team: Jerome Bonnet, Guillaume Cambray, Diego Cattoni, Luca Ciandrini, Pauline Mayonove. 

The majority of classes will consist of practicals in which students will explore the impact of varying regulatory elements on bacterial gene expression using a range of quantitative techniques (plate reader, cytometry) and gene expression systems (living cells and cell-free).


Students will have to present the results of their analysis during a final oral exam. They will also have to discuss an article picked from a provided list during the class.



## **Schedule**

Lectures will provide a brief overview of the field of synthetic biology, and introduce concepts that will be put into practice during this course.
